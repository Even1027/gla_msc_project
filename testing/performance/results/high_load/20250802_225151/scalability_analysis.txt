ACADEMIC SIGNIFICANCE
=================================================

 Literature Context:
Results provide empirical validation of Redis idempotency mechanism
scalability, contributing to the limited literature on microservices
performance under varying load conditions.

 Research Contribution:
- Quantitative scalability boundaries identification
- Performance degradation pattern analysis  
- Load-dependent error rate characterization

 Practical Implications:
Based on empirical evidence, the system demonstrates:
- Reliability: 100% of load levels maintained <1% error rate
- Responsiveness: 0% of load levels maintained <50ms P95 latency

=================================================
SCALABILITY RECOMMENDATIONS
=================================================

 Optimal Operating Range:
System requires optimization for production loads

 Load Balancing Guidance:
- Monitor error rate increases above baseline levels
- Scale horizontally before reaching identified bottlenecks
- Implement circuit breakers for loads exceeding optimal range
