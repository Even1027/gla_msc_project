ACADEMIC SIGNIFICANCE
=================================================

 Literature Context:
This failure recovery test validates system resilience under Redis 
service disruption, supporting the fault tolerance frameworks 
established by Laprie et al. (2004) and Gray & Reuter (1993).

 Research Contribution:
Demonstrates Redis-based idempotency mechanism's recovery behavior,
providing empirical data on system resilience in microservices 
architectures.

 Practical Implications:
Results indicate robust failure recovery, supporting production deployment.
